## Overview

VSYSFileOps is a PowerShell module currently in early stages of development designed to handle common file operations on Windows. Many included functions are meant to be invoked by the Windows Right-Click context menu for maximum convenience. Linux support is not planned for now, but will be phased in after development of the Windows version.
